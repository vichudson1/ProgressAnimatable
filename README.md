# ProgressAnimatable
A protocol with default implementation extension for animating change in views that represent progress. Iâ€™m currently using it to bring life to some [PaintCode](http://www.paintcodeapp.com) drawings, but you could apply it to any view that is drawn based on a `progress: Double` variable between 0 & 1. The protocol is fully [documented](https://github.com/vichudson1/ProgressAnimatable/blob/master/ProgressAnimatable/ProgressAnimatable.swift).

## Demo

Open up the included Xcode project for the sample app to see how to use it.


## Installation

Simply add the [ProgressAnimatable](https://github.com/vichudson1/ProgressAnimatable/blob/master/ProgressAnimatable/ProgressAnimatable.swift) protocol to your project.
