# ProgressAnimatable
A protocol with default implementation extension for animating change in views that represent progress. Iâ€™m currently using it to bring life to some [PaintCode](http://www.paintcodeapp.com) drawings, but you could apply it to any view that is drawn based on a `progress: Double` variable between 0 & 1. The protocol is fully [documented](ProgressAnimatable.swift).

## Demo
